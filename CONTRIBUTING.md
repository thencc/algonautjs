# Contributing

Algonaut.js is a bleeding-edge project maintained by a very small team! We are happy to welcome contributors from the community that would like to make the Algorand ecosystem a little more dev-friendly.

The goal of Algonaut.js is to make developing dApps on Algorand dead-simple. To that end, we encourage contributors to a) file feature requests, b) test the limits of Algonaut.js and report bugs, and c) submit pull requests.

## How to Get Involved

Check out the [Algonaut.js docs](https://thencc.github.io/algonautjs/) and start using the library. If you find anything's missing or broken, file an issue and we can discuss the changes you wish to make to the repository.

Alternatively, check out the [open issues](https://github.com/thencc/algonautjs/issues) and tackle anything up your alley.

## Pull Request Process

1. Increment the version number in `package.json`.
2. Ensure that any methods, variables, etc. are documented with TSDoc comments.
3. Run `npm run build`, which will generate the documentation and prepare the library for publication.
4. Submit your pull request.
5. A project lead will review the pull request and merge or comment if it needs changing.

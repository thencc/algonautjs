# Algonaut.js

Algonaut.js is designed to be a front end developer friendly and browser friendly library to fascilitate intuitive transactions on the Algorand network.  Algorand is incredibly fast, powerful and secure, but it's early days and the tooling is still a little intense.

After working with the existing frameworks for a couple months, we decided to just create what we felt was missing!

## API Approach

We package, expose and depend on the JavaScript Algosdk.  It's there if you need it, but that API is pretty intense for day-to-day use.  With Algonaut.js, you can run one-off transactions with a vastly simplified API as compared to transacting with the Algosdk directly.  We're trying to solve for the 90% cases and let you dive into the hard stuff if you actually need to use it.

``` hi, i'm a code example ```

## Atomic Transactions

One of the most powerful aspects of the Algorand chain is the ability to group transactions together and run them as one.  The API for this is, again, pretty hard to folow for your average FED.  With Algonaut.js we aim to make using this incredibly powerful API a lot more intuitive:

``` i'm a code example. ```
